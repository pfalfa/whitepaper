<p>Alfa gold as crypto assets is a stable coin (relative to the price of gold) build on top of Parity Substrate Framework. 1 Alfa Gold equal to 1 gram of gold.</p>
<p>On the Platform Alfa, Alfa Gold has utility as an asset needed to access technology features and services in the Pfalfa ecosystem. For example, DApps developers will need Alfa Gold to deploy smart contracts, conduct data transactions, etc. DApps users will need the Alfa Gold to be able to enter and access the application services. A tiny fraction of total amount of Alfa Gold spent by users of Pfalfa ecosystem is then accepted by those who maintain the operation of the Pfalfa blockchain (Miner and Provider) in the form of transaction fee. Alfa Gold would become the main medium of exchange for goods and services on Pfalfa Ecosystem. Besides that, public could also use it as a liquid store of value and quick peer to peer cash system.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#technology" id="technology">Technology</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#parity-substrate" id="parity-substrate">Parity Substrate</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Alfa Gold was built on top of Parity Substrate, but what exactly Parity Substrate ? Essentially it's similar to any other framework like web framework, but for building distributed or decentralised systems such as cryptocurrencies. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's key features of what Substrate offers</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#blockchain-as-persistent-storage" id="blockchain-as-persistent-storage">Blockchain as persistent storage</a></h3>
<p>The sole purpose of any blockchain is to provide a way to store and mutate data in a verifiable and globally persistent way, meaning that all parties have a zero-trust way to check and agree on what values should be considered actual in any point in time. Moreover, once such data is sealed, it should be persistent, and depending on the consensus, impossible to modify it.</p>
<p>This property is widely used in cryptocurrencies where persistent storage contains account keys and their actual balances. However, it should be noted that cryptocurrency is not the only possible blockchain application. Basically, almost every system that requires globally coherent, persistent storage and verifiable transaction history may be implemented using a blockchain in one way or another.</p>
<p>Substrate provides efficient storage that is very easy to use and that is tightly integrated with the WebAssembly (Wasm) runtime.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#blockchain-as-a-function" id="blockchain-as-a-function">Blockchain as a function</a></h3>
<p>In order to update the chain state and alter its storage according to pending operations, we need to have a point where decisions are made.</p>
<p>Such decision points may be expressed as a function that takes current state and a set of pending operations and yields another state that should be considered the new actual state of the chain. In the blockchain world, such a function is called the state transition function, or STF for short.</p>
<p>Substrate lets you define such a function in a very manageable and portable way. Much like JavaScript that’s executed on a web page, you may write a set of functions collectively called runtime, that would act as a STF. Additionally, such an implementation would be portable and would not depend on processor architecture, operating system, browser, or be in any other way platform-dependent.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#safety-and-speed" id="safety-and-speed">Safety and speed</a></h3>
<p>One of the most revolutionary parts of Substrate is that the runtime image containing the STF is stored, among other payload, right on the chain. That means that runtime and the whole chain’s business logic may be updated in a secure and verifiable way. Even more, since both Substrate and its Runtime Module Library³ are written in Rust programming language, they can be translated to both native code and Wasm.</p>
<p>At any point in time, client software has two copies of the compiled runtime: one that's compiled in the software natively, and one that is a Wasm image to be executed in a VM. When executing runtime functions, the client software checks whether the on-chain Wasm version of the runtime matches its compiled-to-native, built-in version. When it does, the client software then delegates execution of the runtime functions to the native code version.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#forkless-upgrades" id="forkless-upgrades">Forkless upgrades</a></h3>
<p>When the runtime image gets updated on the chain, some clients will not have updated their software yet. In that case, their node would execute the correct version of the runtime by interpreting it on Substrate’s integrated Wasm virtual machine. So, in any case, all nodes on the network are always able to synchronise the chain correctly (albeit at different levels of efficiency), thus preventing a chain fork.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#p2p-networking" id="p2p-networking">P2P Networking</a></h3>
<p>Blockchain depends on having lots of participants communicating over a network. The typical solution is to use Peer-to-Peer technologies for such communication, and Substrate is not an exception here. P2P is a common name for a set of technologies used to create decentralized networking applications.</p>
<p>The main idea is to have a self-sustaining network environment where every participant (usually called a node) is capable of operating within a network without any prior configuration or interaction with an authority.</p>
<p>To ensure that nodes can join or leave the network at any time without affecting overall network connectivity, Substrate uses the Rust implementation of libp2p, a promising network stack that has everything needed to set up a decentralized network environment.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#consensus" id="consensus">Consensus</a></h3>
<p>Having a state transition function that allows you to move from one state to another is good, but not enough. You also need a way for all nodes to agree on what the next state should be.</p>
<p>As an owner of a bank account, the last thing you want is to have a situation wherein you and your bank disagree on the amount of money you have in your account. Blockchain allows parties to reach consensus without trusting each other (hence zero-trust), even in presence of malicious participants who are actively trying to break the system and steal your money.</p>
<p>This is done using a consensus algorithm with a property called Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT). If a system is BFT, it means that the nodes can reach consensus even if some fraction of them behave arbitrarily badly, including collusion, withholding messages, and being offline. BFT consensus systems achieve resistance against varying degrees of networking issues, where messages can be reordered or delayed. Some BFT consensus systems are designed such that when nodes misbehave (e.g. voting for two blocks at a time), they can be punished and have stake slashed on-chain.</p>
<p>For every consensus engine supported in Substrate, there will be a runtime module designed for handling proofs of misbehavior. The repercussions of evaluating a proof of misbehavior can be determined by the runtime.</p>
<p>It was mathematically proven that this protocol is viable as long as two thirds of the nodes in the network are not malicious and operate according to the protocol. This is one of the reasons why it is important to have a lot of nodes in the network.</p>
<p>Consensus is a critical part of any blockchain application. Luckily, Substrate provides an existing implementation of BFT consensus that can be used almost out of the box.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#light-client-support" id="light-client-support">Light Client Support</a></h3>
<p>Full clients, also known as full nodes, are important for chain security. But as the blockchain grows, the client's database becomes larger and larger. Currently, mainstream cryptocurrencies have databases of several hundreds of gigabytes.</p>
<p>When the full node is initialized, the first thing it needs to do is to synchronize with the rest of the network. Due to security reasons, such a node could not just download the database from a random node &quot;as is.&quot; Instead, it needs to build its own database from scratch by replaying all transactions since genesis (the very first block of the chain). In addition to being computationally expensive, this task requires huge amount of data to be transferred across the network.</p>
<p>I think everyone would agree that downloading half of a terabyte of data to your mobile phone only to buy a sandwich is… impractical if not ridiculous. That's why, almost right from the start, blockchain developers started to think about a way to reduce the costs of maintaining the node, both in storage space and in network throughput.</p>
<p>In the end, the light client concept was born. In a nutshell, a light client is an operating mode of a blockchain node where only the most important data is stored locally and network interaction is reduced to a bare minimum while retaining an acceptable amount of security for almost all interactions anyone is likely to make.</p>
