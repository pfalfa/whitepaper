# Abstract

Although the cloud industry seems very mature with big players like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud their cloud infrastructure still revolve centralized applications with major resources are running in huge centralized data centers. Such platforms are hardly suitable for building decentralized peer-to-peer applications. Also, there is hardly a cost-effective solution for payment flow of micro-transactions.

These issues also exist for platforms dealing with complex multi-party integration across different organizations such as in supply chains, government agencies, and financial institutions. Existing systems depend greatly on high-cost intermediaries and proprietary interfaces that are often very expensive to build and maintain. This makes it challenging for smaller companies to enter into the market.

The good news is that Blockchain has emerged as a new disruptive tool to tackle these issues, ushering in a new era of huge technological advancements. It is democratizing the internet and leveling the business field for consumers and business to operate in a progressively global marketplace.

Pfalfa will democratize this field for cloud infrastructure as well as open-up the market for resource providers and application developers to run and deploy their decentralized applications in a cost-effective way. We are building a decentralized peer-to-peer platform for developer to build decentralized application easily using existing blockchain technology backed by Pfalfa Gold Stablecoin.
