# Pfalfa Token

Pfalfa tokens as crypto assets have two types of values, namely the value of usability or function and the value of scarcity.

Pfalfa token has utility as a token needed to access technology features and services in the Pfalfa ecosystem. For example, DApps developers will need Pfalfa tokens to deploy smart contracts, conduct data transactions, etc. DApps users will need the Pfalfa token to be able to enter and access the application services. The Pfalfa Token issued by users of Pfalfa technology is then accepted by those who maintain the operation of the Pfalfa blockchain as a reward. Greater number of users compared to the number of token sales, will cause more demands for Pfalfa tokens.

The limited supply of Pfalfa tokens of 100,000,000 makes Pfalfa Tokens in the long term have a scarcity value.
