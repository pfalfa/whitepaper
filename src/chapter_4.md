# Identity Hub Service

Pfalfa Identity served as decentralized identity hub inside Pfalfa Platform. It's based on decentralized, peer to peer with public/private key cryptography [GunDB SEA API](https://gun.eco/docs/SEA)

It feature similar to what centralized services offer such as Facebook Login but with fundamentally difference on the backend since Pfalfa will not store password/private key in the server nor transport between server. The private key of user will be kept on the user device.

Pfalfa Identity Hub Service can be used all across the platform for developer to integrate using API, as well as end-user who'd like to use any of dApps under Pfalfa Platform.

### What is Decentralized Identity

Identity is one of the most vital pieces when it comes to the management of user-specific information. With identity theft turning into a major concern nowadays, there is a need to ensure that identity of a human or a machine is self-sovereign and hack-proof. Owning to a huge amount of data associated with identities, there is also a need to ensure that the systems handling identity-related data are capable of handling high scale. That is where Pfalfa comes in as a natural fit for solving identity-related issues because of its combined characteristics of blockchain and database.

A key piece to decentralized identity is how people, devices, and other entities in the world are identified without a centrally owned registry. Decentralized identity re-envisions the way people share access, control, and share their personal information. It gives people power back over their identity.
