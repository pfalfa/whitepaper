# Identity Service

Pfalfa Identity served as decentralized identity hub inside Pfalfa Platform. It's based on decentralized, peer to peer with public/private key cryptography [GunDB SEA API](https://gun.eco/docs/SEA)

It feature similar to what centralized services offer such as Facebook Login but with fundamentally difference on the backend since Pfalfa will not store password/private key in the server nor transport between server. The private key of user will be kept on the user device.
