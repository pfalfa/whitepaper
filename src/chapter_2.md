Centralized cloud services are autocracies, and certain highly decentralized cloud services are pure democracies. Pfalfa, however, intends to be different like a republic of its own. While the autocracies are efficient in certain ways, they also can be fragile. No matter how large the cloud providers are, they can be brought down by power outages, bugs, or any security breaches. In comparison, while pure democracies work towards being a solution to fragility, they tend to prove incapable.

The issues with centralized service providers exist and must be handled in a timely and effective manner. Pfalfa is introducing with a solution, which leverages blockchain and decentralized technology to provide security while maintaining the high-quality service expected within centralized systems.

The focus of the Pfalfa platform is to make a public infrastructure for decentralized applications (DApps). With blockchain and decentralized technology, Pfalfa technology can store and access decentralized data with a very high level of security. In addition, with the peer to peer mechanism, network connectivity can occur either offline and online with smart synchronization.

Pfalfa Platform offers a range of infrastructure capability services including decentralized storage, database, and identity, which can be extended indefinitely.
