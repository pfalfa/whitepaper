                        <h1><a class="header" href="#market-opportunity" id="market-opportunity">Market Opportunity</a></h1>
<h3><a class="header" href="#data-growth-and-underutilization" id="data-growth-and-underutilization">Data Growth and Underutilization</a></h3>
<p>Global data creation is expanding at an exponential frequency. With the advancement in data-driven technology, the percentage of usable data is also expanding. A number of exisitng data services solutions are behind; therefore, there is a huge opportunity for innovation in the market.</p>
<p>With the total projected annual data creation estimated to reach 163 trillion gigabytes (163 ZB) by 2025, data services companies are now struggling to figure out how to scale their capacity to fit in the increasing modern demands <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#usable-data-not-used" id="usable-data-not-used">Usable Data Not Used</a></h3>
<p><img src="https://dev.my.id/pfalfa-wp/market-1.png" alt="Usable data not used" title="usable data not used" /></p>
<p>Usable data is growing in parallel to the total data creation at a 31% rate every year . With businesses going for more storage capacity, they are yet to figure out how to fully optimize utilization, creating an accumulation of underutilized capacity and wasted usable data. </p>
<p>Owing to the difficulties involved with scaling centralized data service systems, less than 50% of purchased capacity is used at any particular time. What this means is that of all the data storage capacity in the market, more than half of it is just dormant. </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#data-center-storage-utilization" id="data-center-storage-utilization">Data Center Storage Utilization</a></h3>
<p><img src="https://dev.my.id/pfalfa-wp/market-2.png" alt="Data Center Storage Utilization" title="Data Center Storage Utilization" /></p>
<p>Without doubt, data growth is swift, there is a need to provide a secure and efficient way to optimize storage utilization.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#data-security" id="data-security">Data Security</a></h3>
<p>The increase in usable data demands a greater need for data security, as demonstrated by recent high profile data leaks from the likes of Dropbox (68 million users affected <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>) , Equifax (145.5 million users affected <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup>) , Facebook (50 million users affected <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#4">4</a></sup>) , and Yahoo (3 billion users affected <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#5">5</a></sup>) .</p>
<p>In any centralized data services solution, a service provider controls their customers’ sensitive data. If security measures are below average and a company becomes a victim to a data breach, such as company can face financial ruin and the service provider can face serious legal consequences. Based on a research done by Cisco, at least a business becomes a victim to a ransomware attack within every 40 seconds. In addition, almost a quarter of the businesses that undergo an attack tend to lose business opportunities, one in five experience the loss of customers, and approximately 30 percent experience the loss of revenue <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#6">6</a></sup> .  Companies handling sensitive and proprietary data are constantly focused on achieving maximum security.</p>
<p>Companies presently take a reactive tactic to fight targeted attacks, instead of building a proactive solution. A reactive tactic entails meticulous monitoring, which demands expensive technology and human capital. In spite of a company’s efforts, there is usually the likelihood of human error. In addition, service providers have structured their privacy policies in a way that they can search non-encrypted files as well as share personal data legally. This alone generates another obvious vulnerability to data breaches, as specified by the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#7">7</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Inadequate security is costly. In 2018, more than 16 top companies, which include Delta and Whole Foods, experienced costly data breaches, and in fact, the raw count of popular data breaches has increased on a yearly basis since 2015 <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#8">8</a></sup> .  Cybercrime damage is assessed to cost around $6 trillion yearly by 2021, up from the $3 trillion of 2015. Cost of cybersecurity is estimated to be more than $1 trillion cumulatively from 2017 to 2021 <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#9">9</a></sup>.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#data-accessibility" id="data-accessibility">Data Accessibility</a></h3>
<p>When customers store data with a big service provider, they are believing that their data will be readily accessible at a fast rate; this means customers want both availability and speed.</p>
<p>Minor outages at data centers seem to be a regular thing. At worst, a 3 to 6-day outage at a foremost cloud provider would cost around $15 billion <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#10">10</a></sup>. Yet, in 2017, 75% of small businesses in the U.S. has no cyber insurance, aggravating the losses suffered during times of data center outages <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#11">11</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Enterprises want to have speedy access to their data at always, even if data sizes are huge. For enterprises with precise accessibility demands, public cloud is not really an optimal solution. With public cloud, enterprises pay a premium so as to have constantly high levels of CPU, high bandwidth, and low latency. This premium is often why enterprises choose to build on-premise infrastructure. With the flexibility within a permission-based market, enterprise customers can find service providers that meet their needs, including the need for availability and speed.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#overhead" id="overhead">Overhead</a></h3>
<p>With the increase in the need for data storage, businesses are becoming concerned with the rising costs. For enterprises (companies with over 1,000 employees), 26% claim to have spent more than $6 million per annum on cloud storage and another 26% claim to have spent between $1.2 million and $6 million per annum on cloud storage. An estimate of 76% of users regard managing cloud spend as an issue, and an estimate of 35% of cloud spend is wasted <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#12">12</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Although the out-of-the-box solutions may be efficient for public cloud, most enterprise applications demand customizable data services. This existing gap is usually filled by private cloud, on-premise solutions, or any hybrid, all of which demand incremental support as well as backup, thereby increasing overhead. This challenge can be tackled through a data services solution that is both flexible and secure enough to satisfy the individual needs of customers regarding their sensitive data.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#market-size" id="market-size">Market Size</a></h3>
<p>The data storage industry itself is huge; the enterprise storage market is on track to make more than $89 billion in revenue by 2022 with growth rates rising above 30% yearly <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#13">13</a></sup>.  Around the same period, the public cloud market is estimated to get to $300 billion in annual spend. As the amount of data increases, sectors into data storage will become more valuable. For instance, disaster recovery as a service is projected to rise from $2.19 billion in 2017 to $12.5 billion by 2022. Likewise, the hyper-converged infrastructure market is estimated to reach $12.6 billion by 2022 with a CAGR of 43.59%. Furthermore, the data colocation market is projected to get to $63 billion in the next five years <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#14">14</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Pfalfa platform is open to all of the data service verticals while also operating as a sharing economy. The cumulative sharing economy is projected to reach $40 billion by 2022 <sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#15">15</a></sup>. This shows that it is an economy that demands our attention.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#the-future-of-data-services" id="the-future-of-data-services">The Future of Data Services</a></h3>
<p>Centralized cloud services are autocracies, and certain highly decentralized cloud services are pure democracies. Pfalfa, however, intends to be different like a republic of its own. While the autocracies are efficient in certain ways, they also can be fragile. No matter how large the cloud providers are, they can be brought down by power outages, bugs, or any security breaches. In comparison, while pure democracies work towards being a solution to fragility, they tend to prove incapable. </p>
<p>The issues with centralized service providers exist and must be handled in a timely and effective manner. Pfalfa is introducing with a solution, which leverages blockchain technology to provide security while maintaining the high-quality service expected within centralized systems. In doing so, Pfalfa is combining the strengths of traditional enterprise-grade hardware and software alongside the security guarantees of the blockchain. 
As industries continue to depend on data, the data services market will continue to grow in both size and significance.</p>
